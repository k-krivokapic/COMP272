/* Complete the getAverage() method. This method should accept two arguments, HashMap and 
arr, where arr is an array of integers. The method then returns a computed average of the values 
of each key found in both the array and HashMap. For example, the keys 1, 2 from the array are 
present in the HashMap, so the average is calculated as (10+20)/2 = 15. The keys ‘7’ and ‘8’ are 
not present in the HashMap, so their corresponding values are not included in the average 
calculation. */
